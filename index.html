          <p>A PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY SANDWICH?!</p>

          <p>That's right, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich was all it took for me to be hooked on coding.</p>
            
          <p>I've always loved logic at it's most basic. Starting in sixth grade, I used to ask teachers for more logic equations. Do you remember those sheets that had a grid and said something crazy like:</p>
            
          <p>"A man is taking his prized pineapple, leopard, llama, and pet leviathan
            (an unique creature that eats llamas and leopards unless a pineapple is
            present) to market. A ship awaits him to cross a river, but he can
            only take one item at a time. How can the man cross the river,
            without the llama eating the pineapple, the leopard eating the llama, and
            the leviathan eating the llama and the leopard?"</p>
            
          <p>When COVID hit over the spring, I purchased a programming book for high school students. For fun! I'd always wanted to learn programming and loved every minute of this book. The first programming assignment was to make a formula for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The task instantly threw me back to middle school days and my embarrassing sixth grade self.</p>
            
          <p>The excitement made me purchase more books and play around in JavaScript, HTML and Python. I also enrolled in a full stack programming boot camp with the University of New Hampshire starting November 2020.</p>
            
          <p>My career thus far has been accomplished. Each day I practice leadership v. management, mindfulness, and truly serve my team. As a leader, I'm here to work for my team. My co-workers would call me diligent, accurate, honest, open, hard-working, and has high standards. For myself and for the teams I work with.</p>
            
          <p>I'm looking to combine my finance, business, and operational experience to truly blossom as a software developer.</p>
