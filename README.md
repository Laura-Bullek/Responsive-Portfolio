# Responsive-Portfolio
Second project in UNH wed developer program

# Description
The **Responsive-Portfolio** project is the second homework assignment of the November 2020 cohort from University of New Hampshire's full-stack coding bootcamp. 

This project was built to demonstrate how a web application will render on various screens or window sizes, such as a tablet, desktop, or mobile phone. The project required a Bootstrap framework, custom CSS syling and HTML built from scratch. It also needed to include the following items:

Minimum Requirements
- Functional, deployed application

- GitHub repository with README describing the project

- Navbar must be consistent on each page.

- Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

- All links must work.

- Must use semantic html.

- Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

- Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

- Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.

## Bonus
- Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (Hint: Check out the Bootstrap documentation).
